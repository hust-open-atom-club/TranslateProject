For most practical specifications, the disassembly and semantic meaning
of an instruction can be determined by looking only at the bits in the
encoding of that instruction. SLEIGH syntax reflects this fact as every
constructor or attached register is ultimately decided by examining
[*fields*]{.emphasis}, the syntactic representation of these instruction
bits. In some cases however, the instruction encoding itself may not be
enough. Additional information, which we refer to as
[*context*]{.emphasis}, may be necessary to fully resolve the meaning of
the instruction.

In truth, almost every modern processor has multiple modes of operation,
where the exact interpretation of instructions may depend on that mode.
Typical examples include distinguishing between a 16-bit mode and a
32-bit mode, or between a big endian mode or a little endian mode. But
for the specification designer, these are of little consequence because
most software for such a processor will run in only one mode without
ever changing it. The designer need only pick the most popular or most
important mode for his projects and design to that. If there is in fact
software that runs under a different mode, the other mode can be
described in a separate specification.

However, for certain processors or software, the need to distinguish
between different interpretations of the same instruction encoding,
based on context, may be a crucial part of the disassembly and analysis
process. There are two typical situations where this becomes necessary.

::: {.informalexample}
::: {.itemizedlist}
-   The processor supports two (or more) separate instruction sets. The
    set to use is usually determined by special bits in a status
    register, and a single piece of software frequently switches between
    these modes.
-   The processor supports instructions that temporarily affect the
    execution of the immediately following instruction(s). For example,
    many processors support hardware [*loop*]{.emphasis} instructions
    that automatically cause the following instructions to repeat
    without an explicit instruction causing the branching and loop
    counting.
:::
:::

SLEIGH solves these problems by introducing [*context
variables*]{.emphasis}. The syntax for defining these symbols was
described in [Section 6.4, "Context
Variables"](sleigh_tokens.html#sleigh_context_variables "6.4. Context Variables"){.xref}.
As mentioned there, the easiest and most common way to use a context
variable is as just another field to use in our bit patterns. It gives
us the extra information we need to distinguish between different
instructions whose encodings are otherwise the same.

### []{#sleigh_context_basic}8.1. Basic Use of Context Variables {#basic-use-of-context-variables .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

Suppose a processor supports the use of two different sets of registers
in its main addressing mode, based on the setting of a status bit which
can be changed dynamically. If an instruction is executed with this bit
cleared, then one set of registers is used, and if the bit is set, the
other registers are used. The instructions otherwise behave identically.

::: {.informalexample}
```
define endian=big;
define space ram type=ram_space size=4 default;
define space register type=register_space size=4;
define register offset=0 size=4 [ r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 ];
define register offset=0x100 size=4 [ s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 ];
define register offset=0x200 size=4 [ statusreg ]; # define context bits (if defined, size must be multiple of 4-bytes)

define token instr(16)
  op=(10,15) rreg1=(7,9) sreg1=(7,9) imm=(0,6)
;
define context statusreg
  mode=(3,3)
;
attach variables [ rreg1 ] [ r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 ];
attach variables [ sreg1 ] [ s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 ];

Reg1: rreg1 is mode=0 & rreg1 { export rreg1; }
Reg1: sreg1 is mode=1 & sreg1 { export sreg1; }

:addi Reg1,#imm  is op=1 & Reg1 & imm { Reg1 = Reg1 + imm; }
```
:::

In this example the symbol [*Reg1*]{.emphasis} uses the 3 bits (7,9) to
select one of eight registers. If the context variable
[*mode*]{.emphasis} is set to 0, it selects an [*r*]{.emphasis}
register, through the [*rreg1*]{.emphasis} field. If [*mode*]{.emphasis}
is set to 1 on the other hand, an [*s*]{.emphasis} register is selected
instead via [*sreg1*]{.emphasis}. The [*addi*]{.emphasis} instruction
(encoded as 0x0590 for example) can disassemble in one of two ways.

::: {.informalexample}
```
addi r3,#0x10    OR
addi s3,#0x10
```
:::

This is the same behavior as if [*mode*]{.emphasis} were defined as a
field instead of a context variable, except that there is nothing in the
instruction encoding itself which indicates which of the two forms will
be chosen. An engine doing the disassembly will have global state
associated with the [*mode*]{.emphasis} variable that will make the
final decision about which form to generate. The setting of this state
is (at least partially) out of the control of SLEIGH, although see the
following sections.

### []{#sleigh_local_change}8.2. Local Context Change {#local-context-change .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

SLEIGH can make direct modifications to context variables through
statements in the disassembly action section of a constructor. The
left-hand side of an assignment statement in this section can be a
context variable, see [Section 7.5.2, "General Actions and Pattern
Expressions"](sleigh_constructors.html#sleigh_general_actions "7.5.2. General Actions and Pattern Expressions"){.xref}.
Because the result of this assignment is calculated in the middle of the
instruction disassembly, the change in value of the context variable can
potentially affect any remaining parsing for that instruction. A modal
variable is being added to what was otherwise a stateless grammar, a
common technique in many practical parsing engines.

Any assignment statement changing a context variable is immediately
executed upon the successful match of the constructor containing the
statement and can be used to guide the parsing of the constructor\'s
operands. We introduce two more instructions to the example
specification from the previous section.

::: {.informalexample}
```
:raddi Reg1,#imm is op=2 & Reg1 & imm [ mode=0; ] {
    Reg1 = Reg1 + imm;
}
:saddi Reg1,#imm is op=3 & Reg1 & imm [ mode=1; ] {
    Reg1 = Reg1 + imm;
}
```
:::

Notice that both new constructors modify the context variable
[*mode*]{.emphasis}. The raddi instruction sets mode to 0 and
effectively guarantees that an [*r*]{.emphasis} register will be
produced by the disassembly. Similarly, the [*saddi*]{.emphasis}
instruction can force an [*s*]{.emphasis} register. Both are in contrast
to the [*addi*]{.emphasis} instruction, which depends on a global state.
The changes to [*mode*]{.emphasis} made by these instructions only
persist for parsing of that single instruction. For any following
instructions, if the matching constructors use [*mode*]{.emphasis}, its
value will have reverted to its original global state. The same holds
for any context variable modified with this syntax. If an instruction
needs to permanently modify the state of a context variable, the
designer must use constructions described in [Section 8.3, "Global
Context
Change"](sleigh_context.html#sleigh_global_change "8.3. Global Context Change"){.xref}.

Clearly, the behavior of the above example could be easily replicated
without using context variables at all and having the selection of a
register set simply depend directly on the [*op*]{.emphasis} field. But,
with more complicated addressing modes, local modification of context
variables can drastically reduce the complexity and size of a
specification.

At the point where a modification is made to a context variable, the
specification designer has the guarantee that none of the operands of
the constructor have been evaluated yet, so if their matching depends on
this context variable, they will be affected by the change. In contrast,
the matching of any ancestor constructor cannot be affected. Other
constructors, which are not direct ancestors or descendants, may or may
not be affected by the change, depending on the order of evaluation. It
is usually best not to depend on this ordering when designing the
specification, with the possible exception of orderings which are
guaranteed by [**build**]{.bold} directives.

### []{#sleigh_global_change}8.3. Global Context Change {#global-context-change .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

It is possible for an instruction to attempt a permanent change to a
context variable, which would then affect the parsing of other
instructions, by using the [**globalset**]{.bold} directive in a
disassembly action. As mentioned in the previous section, context
variables have an associated global state, which can be used during
constructor matching. A complete model for this state is, unfortunately,
outside the scope of SLEIGH. The disassembly engine has to make too many
decisions about what is getting disassembled and what assumptions are
being made to give complete control of the context to SLEIGH. Because of
this caveat, SLEIGH syntax for making permanent context changes should
be viewed as a suggestion to the disassembly engine.

For processors that support multiple modes, there are typically specific
instructions that switch between these modes. Extending the example from
the previous sections, we add two instructions to the specification for
permanently switching which register set is being used.

::: {.informalexample}
```
:rmode is op=32 & rreg1=0 & imm=0
       [ mode=0; globalset(inst_next,mode); ]
{}
:smode is op=33 & rreg1=0 & imm=0
       [ mode=1; globalset(inst_next,mode); ]
{}
```
:::

The register set is, as before, controlled by the [*mode*]{.emphasis}
variable, and as with a local change to context, the variable is
assigned to inside the square brackets. The [*rmode*]{.emphasis}
instruction sets [*mode*]{.emphasis} to 0, in order to select
[*r*]{.emphasis} registers via [*rreg1*]{.emphasis}, and
[*smode*]{.emphasis} sets [*mode*]{.emphasis} to 1 in order to select
[*s*]{.emphasis} registers. As is described in [Section 8.2, "Local
Context
Change"](sleigh_context.html#sleigh_local_change "8.2. Local Context Change"){.xref},
these assignments by themselves cause only a local context change.
However, the subsequent [**globalset**]{.bold} directives make the
change persist outside of the the instructions themselves. The
[**globalset**]{.bold} directive takes two parameters, the second being
the particular context variable being changed. The first parameter
indicates the first address where the new context takes effect. In the
example, the expectation is that a mode change affects any subsequent
instructions. So the first parameter to [**globalset**]{.bold} here is
[*inst\_next*]{.emphasis}, indicating that the new value of
[*mode*]{.emphasis} begins at the next address.

#### []{#sleigh_contextflow}8.3.1. Context Flow {#context-flow .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

A global change to context that affects instruction decoding is
typically open-ended. I.e. once the mode switching instruction is
executed, a permanent change is made to the run-time processor state,
and all future instruction decoding is affected, until another mode
switch is encountered. In terms of SLEIGH by default, the effect of a
[**globalset**]{.bold} directive follows [*flow*]{.emphasis}. Starting
from the address specified in the directive, the change in context
follows the control-flow of the instructions, through branches and
calls, until an execution path terminates or another context change is
encountered.

Flow following behavior can be overridden by adding the
[**noflow**]{.bold} attribute to the definition of the context field.
(See [Section 6.4, "Context
Variables"](sleigh_tokens.html#sleigh_context_variables "6.4. Context Variables"){.xref})
In this case, a [**globalset**]{.bold} directive only affects the
context of a single instruction at the specified address. Subsequent
instructions retain their original context. This can be useful in a
variety of situations but is typically used to let one instruction alter
the behavior, not necessarily the decoding, of the following
instruction. In the example below, an indirect branch instruction jumps
through a link register [*lr*]{.emphasis}. If the previous instruction
moves the program counter in to [*lr*]{.emphasis}, it communicates this
to the branch instruction through the [*LRset*]{.emphasis} context
variable so that the branch can be interpreted as a return, rather than
a generic indirect branch.

::: {.informalexample}
```
define context contextreg
  LRset = (1,1) noflow  # 1 if the instruction before was a mov lr,pc
;
  ...
mov lr,pc  is opcode=34 & lr & pc
           [ LRset=1; globalset(inst_next,LRset); ] { lr = pc; }
  ...
blr        is opcode=35 & reg=15 & LRset=0 { goto [lr]; }
blr        is opcode=35 & reg=15 & LRset=1 { return [lr]; }
```
:::

An alternative to the [**noflow**]{.bold} attribute is to simply issue
multiple directives within a single constructor, so an explicit end to a
context change can be given. The value of the variable exported to the
global state is the one in effect at the point where the directive is
issued. Thus, after one [**globalset**]{.bold}, the same context
variable can be assigned a different value, followed by another
[**globalset**]{.bold} for a different address.

Because context in SLEIGH is controlled by a disassembly process, there
are some basic caveats to the use of the [**globalset**]{.bold}
directive. With [*flowing*]{.emphasis} context changes, there is no
guarantee of what global state will be in effect at a particular
address. During disassembly, at any given point, the process may not
have uncovered all the relevant directives, and the known directives may
not necessarily be consistent. In general, for most processors, the
disassembly at a particular address is intended to be absolute. So given
enough information, it should be possible to make a definitive
determination of what the context is at a certain address, but there is
no guarantee. It is up to the disassembly process to fully determine
where context changes begin and end and what to do if there are
conflicts.
