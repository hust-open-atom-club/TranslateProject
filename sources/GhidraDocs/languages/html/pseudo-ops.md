# Pseudo P-CODE Operations

Practical analysis systems need to be able to describe operations, whose
exact effect on a machine\'s memory state is not fully modeled. P-code
allows for this by defining a small set of *pseudo*{.emphasis}
operators. Such an operator is generally treated as a placeholder for
some, possibly large, sequence of changes to the machine state. In terms
of analysis, either the operator is just carried through as a black-box
or it serves as a plug-in point for operator substitution or other
specially tailored transformation. Pseudo operators may violate the
requirement placed on other p-code operations that all effects must be
explicit.

### USERDEFINED

|Parameters|Description|
|:-:|-:|
|input0(**special**)|Constant ID of user-defined op to perform.|
|input1|First parameter of user-defined op.|
|...|Additional parameters of user-defined op.|
|[output]|Optional output of user-defined op.|

**Semantic statement**

`userop(input1, ... );`

`output = userop(input1,...);`

This is a placeholder for (a family of) user-definable p-code
instructions. It allows p-code instructions to be defined with semantic
actions that are not fully specified. Machine instructions that are too
complicated or too esoteric to fully implement can use one or more
**USERDEFINED** instructions as placeholders for their
semantics.

The first input parameter input0 is a constant ID assigned by the
specification to a particular semantic action. Depending on how the
specification defines the action associated with the ID, the
**USERDEFINED** instruction can take an arbitrary number of
input parameters and optionally have an output parameter. Exact details
are processor and specification dependent. Ideally, the output parameter
is determined by the input parameters, and no variable is affected
except the output parameter. But this is no longer a strict requirement,
side-effects are possible. Analysis should generally treat these
instructions as a "black-box" which still have normal data-flow and can
be manipulated symbolically.

### CPOOLREF

|Parameters|Description|
|:-:|-:|
|input0|Varnode containing pointer offset to object.|
|input1(**special**)|Constant ID indicating type of value to return.|
|...|Additional parameters describing value to return.|
|output|Varnode to contain requested size, offset, or address.|

**Semantic statement**

`output = cpool(input0,intput1);`

This operator returns specific run-time dependent values from the
*constant pool*{.emphasis}. This is a concept for object-oriented
instruction sets and other managed code environments, where some details
about how instructions behave can be deferred until run-time and are not
directly encoded in the instruction. The **CPOOLREF** operator
acts a query to the system to recover this type of information. The
first parameter is a pointer to a specific object, and subsequent
parameters are IDs or other special constants describing exactly what
value is requested, relative to the object. The canonical example is
requesting a method address given just an ID describing the method and a
specific object, but **CPOOLREF** can be used as a placeholder
for recovering any important value the system knows about. Details about
this instruction, in terms of emulation and analysis, are necessarily
architecture dependent.

### NEW

|Parameters|Description|
|:-:|-:|
|input0|Varnode containing class reference|
|[input1]|If present, varnode containing count of objects to allocate.|
|output|Varnode to contain pointer to allocated memory.|

**Semantic statement**

`output = new(input0);`

This operator allocates memory for an object described by the first
parameter and returns a pointer to that memory. This is used to model
object-oriented instruction sets where object allocation is an atomic
operation. Exact details about how memory is affected by a
**NEW** operation is generally not modeled in these cases, so
the operator serves as a placeholder to allow analysis to proceed.
