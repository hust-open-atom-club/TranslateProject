### []{#sleigh_defining_tokens}6.1. Defining Tokens and Fields {#defining-tokens-and-fields .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

A [*token*]{.emphasis} is one of the byte-sized pieces that make up the
machine code instructions being modeled. Instruction
[*fields*]{.emphasis} must be defined on top of them. A
[*field*]{.emphasis} is a logical range of bits within an instruction
that can specify an opcode, or an operand etc. Together tokens and
fields determine the basic interpretation of bits and how many bytes the
instruction takes up. To define a token and the fields associated with
it, we use the [**define token**]{.bold} statement.

::: {.informalexample}
```
define token tokenname ( integer )
  fieldname=(integer,integer) attributelist
  ...
;
```
:::

The first part of the definition defines the name of a token and the
number of bits it uses (this must be a multiple of 8). Following this
there are one or more field declarations specifying the name of the
field and the range of bits within the token making up the field. The
size of a field does [*not*]{.emphasis} need to be a multiple of 8. The
range is inclusive where the least significant bit in the token is
labeled 0. When defining tokens that are bigger than 1 byte, the global
endianness setting (See [Section 4.1, "Endianness
Definition"](sleigh_definitions.html#sleigh_endianness_definition "4.1. Endianness Definition"){.xref})
will affect this labeling. Although it is rarely required, it is
possible to override the global endianness setting for a specific token
by appending either the qualifier [**endian=little**]{.bold} or
[**endian=big**]{.bold} immediately after the token name and size. For
instance:

::: {.informalexample}
```
  define token instr ( 32 ) endian=little op0=(0,15) ...
```
:::

The token [*instr*]{.emphasis} is overridden to be little endian. This
override applies to all fields defined for the token but affects no
other tokens.

After each field declaration, there can be zero or more of the following
attribute keywords:

::: {.informalexample}
```
signed
hex
dec
```
:::

These attributes are defined in the next section. There can be any
manner of repeats and overlaps in the fields so long as they all have
different names.

### []{#sleigh_fields_family}6.2. Fields as Family Symbols {#fields-as-family-symbols .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

Fields are the most basic form of family symbol; they define a natural
map from instruction bits to a specific symbol as follows. We take the
set of bits within the instruction as given by the field's defining
range and treat them as an integer encoding. The resulting integer is
both the display portion and the semantic meaning of the specific
symbol. The display string is obtained by converting the integer into
either a decimal or hexadecimal representation (see below), and the
integer is treated as a constant varnode in any semantic action.

The attributes of the field affect the resulting specific symbol in
obvious ways. The [**signed**]{.bold} attribute determines whether the
integer encoding should be treated as just an unsigned encoding or if a
twos-complement encoding should be used to obtain a signed integer. The
[**hex**]{.bold} or [**dec**]{.bold} attributes describe whether the
integer should be displayed with a hexadecimal or decimal
representation. The default is hexadecimal. \[Currently the
[**dec**]{.bold} attribute is not supported\]

### []{#sleigh_alternate_meanings}6.3. Attaching Alternate Meanings to Fields {#attaching-alternate-meanings-to-fields .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

The default interpretation of a field is probably the most natural but
of course processors interpret fields within an instruction in a wide
variety of ways. The [**attach**]{.bold} keyword is used to alter either
the display or semantic meaning of fields into the most common (and
basic) interpretations. More complex interpretations must be built up
out of tables.

::: {.sect3}
::: {.titlepage}
<div>

<div>

#### []{#sleigh_attaching_registers}6.3.1. Attaching Registers {#attaching-registers .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

Probably [*the*]{.emphasis} most common processor interpretation of a
field is as an encoding of a particular register. In SLEIGH this can be
done with the [**attach variables**]{.bold} statement:

::: {.informalexample}
```
attach variables fieldlist registerlist;
```
:::

A [*fieldlist*]{.emphasis} can be a single field identifier or a space
separated list of field identifiers surrounded by square brackets. A
[*registerlist*]{.emphasis} must be a square bracket surrounded and
space separated list of register identifiers as created with
[**define**]{.bold} statements (see Section [Section 4.4, "Naming
Registers"](sleigh_definitions.html#sleigh_naming_registers "4.4. Naming Registers"){.xref}).
For each field in the [*fieldlist*]{.emphasis}, instead of having the
display and semantic meaning of an integer, the field becomes a look-up
table for the given list of registers. The original integer
interpretation is used as the index into the list starting at zero, so a
specific instruction that has all the bits in the field equal to zero
yields the first register (a specific varnode) from the list as the
meaning of the field in the context of that instruction. Note that both
the display and semantic meaning of the field are now taken from the new
register.

A particular integer can remain unspecified by putting a '\_' character
in the appropriate position of the register list or also if the length
of the register list is less than the integer. A specific integer
encoding of the field that is unspecified like this does
[*not*]{.emphasis} revert to the original semantic and display meaning.
Instead this encoding is flagged as an invalid form of the instruction.

#### []{#sleigh_attaching_integers}6.3.2. Attaching Other Integers {#attaching-other-integers .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

Sometimes a processor interprets a field as an integer but not the
integer given by the default interpretation. A different integer
interpretation of the field can be specified with an [**attach
values**]{.bold} statement.

::: {.informalexample}
```
attach values fieldlist integerlist;
```
:::

The [*integerlist*]{.emphasis} is surrounded by square brackets and is a
space separated list of integers. In the same way that a new register
interpretation is assigned to fields with an [**attach
variables**]{.bold} statement, the integers in the list are assigned to
each field specified in the [*fieldlist*]{.emphasis}. \[Currently SLEIGH
does not support unspecified positions in the list using a '\_'\]

::: {.sect3}
::: {.titlepage}
<div>

<div>

#### []{#sleigh_attaching_names}6.3.3. Attaching Names {#attaching-names .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

It is possible to just modify the display characteristics of a field
without changing the semantic meaning. The need for this is rare, but it
is possible to treat a field as having influence on the display of the
disassembly but having no influence on the semantics. Even if the bits
of the field do have some semantic meaning, sometimes it is appropriate
to define overlapping fields, one of which is defined to have no
semantic meaning. The most convenient way to break down the required
disassembly may not be the most convenient way to break down the
semantics. It is also possible to have symbols with semantic meaning but
no display meaning (see [Section 7.4.5, "Invisible
Operands"](sleigh_constructors.html#sleigh_invisible_operands "7.4.5. Invisible Operands"){.xref}).

At any rate we can list the display interpretation of a field directly
with an [**attach names**]{.bold} statement.

::: {.informalexample}
```
attach names fieldlist stringlist;
```
:::

The [*stringlist*]{.emphasis} is assigned to each of the fields in the
same manner as the [**attach variables**]{.bold} and [**attach
values**]{.bold} statements. A specific encoding of the field now
displays as the string in the list at that integer position. Field
values greater than the size of the list are interpreted as invalid
encodings.

### []{#sleigh_context_variables}6.4. Context Variables {#context-variables .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

SLEIGH supports the concept of [*context variables*]{.emphasis}. For the
most part processor instructions can be unambiguously decoded by
examining only the bits of the instruction encoding. But in some cases,
decoding may depend on the state of processor. Typically, the processor
will have some set of status flags that indicate what mode is being used
to process instructions. In terms of SLEIGH, a context variable is a
[*field*]{.emphasis} which is defined on top of a register rather than
the instruction encoding (token).

::: {.informalexample}
```
define context contextreg
  fieldname=(integer,integer) attributelist
  ...
;
```
:::

Context variables are defined with a [**define context**]{.bold}
statement. The keywords must be followed by the name of a defined
register. The remaining part of the definition is nearly identical to
the normal definition of fields. Each context variable defined on this
register is listed in turn, specifying the name, the bit range, and any
attributes. All the normal field attributes, [**signed**]{.bold},
[**dec**]{.bold}, and [**hex**]{.bold}, can also be used for context
variables.

Context variables introduce a new, dedicated, attribute:
[**noflow**]{.bold}. By default, globally setting a context variable
affects instruction decoding from the point of the change, forward,
following the flow of the instructions, but if the variable is labeled
as [**noflow**]{.bold}, any change is limited to a single instruction.
(See [Section 8.3.1, "Context
Flow"](sleigh_context.html#sleigh_contextflow "8.3.1. Context Flow"){.xref})

Once the context variable is defined, in terms of the specification
syntax, it can be treated as if it were just another field. See
[Section 8, "Using
Context"](sleigh_context.html "8. Using Context"){.xref}, for a complete
discussion of how to use context variables.
