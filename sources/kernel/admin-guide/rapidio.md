# RapidIO Subsystem Guide

Author

:   Matt Porter

## Introduction

RapidIO is a high speed switched fabric interconnect with features aimed
at the embedded market. RapidIO provides support for memory-mapped I/O
as well as message-based transactions over the switched fabric network.
RapidIO has a standardized discovery mechanism not unlike the PCI bus
standard that allows simple detection of devices in a network.

This documentation is provided for developers intending to support
RapidIO on new architectures, write new drivers, or to understand the
subsystem internals.

## Known Bugs and Limitations

### Bugs

None. ;)

### Limitations

1.  Access/management of RapidIO memory regions is not supported
2.  Multiple host enumeration is not supported

## RapidIO driver interface

Drivers are provided a set of calls in order to interface with the
subsystem to gather info on devices, request/map memory region
resources, and manage mailboxes/doorbells.
