# Conclusion

Open source software is a form of digital public good, creating wealth and capability for
society as a whole in a continuously-renewing form. The private sector’s substantial investments into the creation of OSS, and further securing OSS, have created public value and
positioned OSS as critical infrastructure, as critical as any highway or bridge. Ad-hoc efforts
to improve security have reached a limit. We believe for the value invested these new, organized approaches to improving security across the board will have an outsized impact.
We are very eager to collaborate on further iterations of this document with software
experts and organizations with involvement in or dependency upon the global OSS ecosystem. Help us take this plan to a reference-quality version 1.0 and beyond, and to help
identify the resources required to implement. Please get in touch with us at [operations@openssf.org](mailto:operations@openssf.org) or join the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) community to engage.
