# Executive Summary

The modern software supply chain relies pervasively on open source software ("OSS") for
both underlying components and operation. The ability for organizations (including companies and governments) to innovate faster, and at a higher level of quality, is often linked
to their adoption of OSS components. Roughly 70-90% of any software "stack" consists of
OSS[^1][^2]. That shared benefit also comes with shared risk in the form of exposure to vulnerabilities in those OSS components.

**Vulnerabilities and weaknesses in widely deployed software present systemic threats
to the security and stability of modern society as government services, infrastructure
providers, nonprofits and the vast majority of private businesses rely on software in
order to function.**

The software supply chain is complex and as susceptible to disruption and corruption as any
physical supply chain. While the private sector constantly invests in protecting the software
supply chain via standards, shared services, and solutions to reduce risk of both inadvertent
errors and intentional attacks, just as with physical infrastructure (ports, power grids, telecommunications networks, etc) the public sector can and should play a role in hardening the
systems. The public and private sectors must work together to meet the collective security
and safety needs of citizens and stakeholders, facing even greater challenges in addressing
these threats.

While there are considerable ongoing efforts to secure the OSS supply chain, to achieve
acceptable levels of resilience and risk, a more comprehensive series of investments to shift
security from a largely reactive exercise to a proactive approach is required. Our objective is
to evolve the systems and processes used to ensure a higher degree of security assurance
and trust in the OSS supply chain.

This paper suggests a comprehensive portfolio of 10 initiatives which can start immediately
to address three fundamental goals for hardening the software supply chain. Vulnerabilities
and weaknesses in widely deployed software present systemic threats to the security and
stability of modern society as government services, infrastructure providers, nonprofits and
the vast majority of private businesses rely on software in order to function.

With OSS we have the ability to directly and systematically mitigate the risks associated with
OSS use that we do not have with proprietary software. This is due to the availability of the
underlying source code, the way most development teams do their work in the open, and
the significant amount of cross-project reuse of components and concepts.

**Smart investments into systematic enhancements in the way OSS is developed,
recombined, distributed, and deployed, as well as into specific highly re-used "critical"
pieces, would be a highly leveraged and cost-effective way to reduce the risk for all
downstream users. This includes the many proprietary and custom software solutions
that incorporate OSS.**

All software should be assumed to have defects, and all software development teams will at
one point or another inadvertently allow a defect into their code, despite best efforts. Working
with the teams managing open source projects is critical to the success of any of the above
objectives. The managers of OSS projects are typically called "maintainers"; they actively manage the roadmap and release cadence of an open source project, as opposed to the broader
category of "contributors". Maintainers are also the first line of defense in holding off any
malicious attempts to insert bad code into projects, or to protect against changes in other OSS
projects that are implicitly or explicitly included in their software that may harm their users.

Thus, all forms of investment and intervention should be focused on delivering new value to
OSS maintainers — from making it easier to adopt practices that enhance the security and
integrity of their work, to funding activities like third party code reviews that most projects
struggle to afford to perform on their own. Any investments or policies that place additional
burdens on developers, increase their personal or professional liability for working on code,
or issue unfunded mandates upon them, would struggle for adoption and potentially inhibit
further advancements in open source software. Any successful approach must be collaborative, offering not only guidance but also education, support, and technical resources.
This will be crucial in striking the balance between creating a strong impetus for change and
winning the trust of OSS communities to drive adoption.

Companies who make extensive use of OSS long ago realized it was in their best interest to
know what OSS was coming in through their supply chain. Initially this was for legal and software license compliance, but now increasingly is for tracking of vulnerable software assets.
Those companies have tended to also create Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to systematically manage their engagement with the OSS projects they consume, as well as to follow
professional and technical standards for the OSS code they upstream or release themselves.
Those companies tend to put an emphasis on security best practices, train their employees on
how to develop secure software, fund security audits for the OSS they rely upon, and invest in
tooling to spot issues or projects of concern before they become an issue.

It’s time we apply these software security best practices to the whole of the software ecosystem, and the OSS ecosystem is the critical place to start because of the shared dependency
most organizations in the world have on the same commonly-used OSS components.
